                    <br />
                    
                    This unfortunate fact can even hold true in cases in which the cancer is diagnosed and treated early in its development, although such a situation can benefit the outlook of the disease when compared to its later stages.

                <div id = "content_holder" style = "top:179vh;">
                    Pancreatic Cancer is comprised of tumors found in or near the pancreatic region of the body. The <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/pancreatic-cancer/', '_blank', 'location=yes');" class = "link">pancreas</span> is a 6-inch long organ that can be found behind the stomach in the back of the abdomen. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Its function in the body is essential: it secretes hormones and sends them to glands in order to perform routine body functions. Pancreatic Cancer involves the uncontrollable growth of pancreatic cells that impede the normal functioning of the pancreas.

                    Lets begin by going through the specifics of each type of Pancreatic Cancer as highlighted above. The graph below reveals the prominence of the 2 different types of Pancreatic Cancers relative to each other. The clear leader is <span style="color:#C62828">Exocrine Tumors</span>, with <span style="color:#0D47A1">Endocrine</span> Tumors coving a tiny fraction of total Pancreatic Cancer cases.

                    Exocrine Tumors are easily the most common form of Pancreatic Cancers. Because of this, a diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer is almost always referring to this specific type of tumor. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Formulating a working knowledge of the differences between Exocrine and Endocrine Tumors is important due to the differences in prognosis and methods of treatment that each subset of the disease demands.

                <span style = "position:relative;top:-15px;">
                    Endocrine Tumors occur significantly less than Exocrine Tumors largely because only about 5% of the cells in the pancreas are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis', '_blank', 'location=yes');">Enteroendocrine (Endocrine) Cells</span>. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While Exocrine Tumors are known for spreading to other systems in the body, Endocrine Tumors are typically only able to spread within the pancreas itself, thus limiting the mortality rate of this disease significantly.
