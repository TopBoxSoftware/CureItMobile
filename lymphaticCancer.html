Lymphoma is classified as the uncontrollable growth of a specific type of white blood cell called a 
<span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system', '_blank', 'location=yes');">lymphatic cell</span>. It is a variant of Blood Cancer, but possesses enough unique properties to warrant individual analysis. 
<br />
<br />
There are 2 main types of Lymphatic Cancers: Hodgkin's Disease, and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. 
<br />
<br />
The specifics of both of these will be dissected in great detail down below.

                <div id = "content_holder" style = "top:179vh;">
                    Because Lymphoma affects the lymphatic system, it poses a direct threat to the immune system. This is because lymphatic cells are a type of white blood cell.
					<br />
					<br />
					When functioning properly, these cells usually attack pathogens, bacteria, and viruses the moment they enter the body. Once these white blood cells are mutated through Lymphatic Cancers, the body begins to have difficulty fighting off even small viruses like mild colds. 
					<br />
					<br />
					This has the effect of turning mild conditions into severe medical crises.

					<br />
					<br />
					It is the 6th most common form of cancer in men, and the 5th most common cancer in women, thus posing a serious threat to everybody. Unfortunately, its prominence has been on the rise for decades.

                    Hodgkin's Disease (sometimes referred to as HD) attacks the same area that Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma does: the lymphocytes. Hodgkin's Disease takes over these cells, and in doing so weakens the immune system.
					<br />
					<br />
					This has the adverse effect of making the body more prone to sickness. Because of this, the symptoms of Hodgkin's Disease are very similar to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

					  While such therapies have existed for some time now, recent developments have made this form of treatment significantly more effective and comfortable for the patient when applied against Lymphatic Cancers.
