		My story is a bit complicated. I was officially diagnosed in January 2015, after a year and a half of trying to figure out what was making me sick. I started feeling sick in October 2013. Upset tummy, dizziness, pains in my side. It was brushed off as a tummy bug, extended by digestive issues. 
                <br />
                <br />
                It didn't go away, I went back. It took months of this, and emergency room visits in crazy pain. Ultrasounds showed some fluid in my belly, but not much else. One of my fallopian tubes was a bit swollen. After endless gyno, and gastroenterologist visits, it was decided I needed an exploratory laparoscopy, in April. 
                <br />
                <br />
                They got five Litres of fluid out of my abdomen, and saw what looks like white sand on all my organs. This was the first time I heard "we might be looking at a cancer diagnosis." Unfortunately, all the samples they took were inconclusive. the surgeon, my doctors, and an oncologist in my city and a specialist in a city five hours away couldn't commit to a diagnosis. 
                <br />
                <br />
                It was either mesothelioma, or maybe an unkown autoimmune response. I was scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy for November. We did that. They sent samples to everyone they could think of. Ten samples in all. In December, I was told it was definitely not mesothelioma, though it looked a lot like it. 
                <br />
                <br />
                We celebrated, even though they didn't know what was wrong. I got a call in early January. The oncologist told me one of the samples made to a doctor who is part of an international team that studies mesothelioma. 
                <br /> 
                <br />
                It turns out it was two kinds of mesothelioma mixed together, and very atypical. It's officially diagnosed as biphasic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. She told me over the phone because she wanted to get the ball rolling on treatment. Four days later, I was in the other city, in the specialists office booking my surgery and treatment. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Had cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC chemo in February. I'm still in recovery. I lost six organs total (mostly minor), half my intestines, fifty pounds so far, and two years of my life. It's been unreal. Recovery was worse than the cancer. I am still be monitored closely to see of the procedure was a success.
