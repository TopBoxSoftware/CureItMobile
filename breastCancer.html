                    Breast Cancer is a disease in which a group of tumorous cells begins developing in the reigons associated with the breast.   
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All Breast Cancers fall into two categories: Invasive or Non-Invasive.
                    
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    
                    There do exist other ways of classifying this deadly disease, such as Recurrent and Metastatic Breast Cancers, and establishing a basic understanding of these is important in terms of fully appreciating the conditions that Breast Cancer patients must deal with everyday.

                     Breast Cancer is one of the most widespread and life-threatening cancers currently around today. In fact, Breast Cancer death rates for women are <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics', '_blank', 'location=yes');" class = "link">second only to lung cancer in the United States</span>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While popular belief dictates that it is only females who are at risk for this form of cancer, men do possess breast tissue and thus <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancerinmen/detailedguide/breast-cancer-in-men-what-is-breast-cancer-in-men', '_blank', 'location=yes');">can contract this disease as well</span>, albiet far less often than females.

Below is a chart that specifies the estimated percentage of occurance between Breast Cancer in various age groups: <span style = "color:#F7464A">less than 40</span>, <span style = "color:#0D47A1">less than 50</span>, <span style = "color:#7A5230">between 50 and 60</span>, and <span style = "color:#4CAF50">more than 65</span>

                        Determining whether the Breast Cancer is invasive or not is an essential step in terms of establishing a healthy, effective treatement plan on an individual level.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The vast majority of Breast Cancers are invasive - <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/invasive', '_blank', 'location=yes');">about 79 percent, in fact</span> - meaning that the cancer develops into areas that used to be composed of normal, healthy tissue.

                    <br />

                <span style = "position:relative;top:-15px;">
                    At its most basic level, Recurrent Breast Cancer is Breast Cancer that <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/breast-cancer-recurrence', '_blank', 'location=yes');">returns after initial treatement</span>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is often very difficult to detect and eliminate because initial treatements are designed with the intent of eliminating all cancerous cells, meaning that some patients let their guard down after completion.
