Bone Cancer is one of the more frightening forms of cancer due to the ease with which it can spread.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    
                                    
                                    There are 3 primary types of bone cancers: Osteosarcomas, Ewing Tumors (ET), and Chondrosarcomas. All of these will be discussed in great detail below.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Bone Cancers, as the name implies, are abnormal clusters of cells that originate within bones.
                                    
                                
                                </div>
                                
                            </span>
                            <div class="swiper-slide" id = "third_main_color">
                                <span id = "title" style = "top:168vh">Introduction (2/3)</span>
                                <div id = "content_holder" style = "top:179vh;">
                                    Bone Cancers, as the name implies, are abnormal clusters of cells that originate within bones. One reason that these cells are dangerous is because they lead to the death of normal bone tissue.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                
                                    However, another danger comes at the form with which this cancer can metastasize, or spread, around the body.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    Since bones exist in practically every system and area of the body, this disease has the potential to be spread almost anywhere.

                    As illustrated by the chart above, Osteosarcoma is the most frequent form of Bone Cancer. Before discussing how this form of cancer impacts patients, it is first essential to understand the implications of the cancer's location in the <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://www.innerbody.com/image/skelfov.html', '_blank', 'location=yes');">skeletal system</span>.

                    The role
                    of the skeletal system in the body is essential, as it provides for protection and support for a wide variety of bodily functions.

                        Ewing Tumors are relatively uncommon, accounting for just 34 percent of all Bone Cancer cases. They usually form in the same spots as Osteosarcomas, but there are a few noteable exceptions to this generalization.
