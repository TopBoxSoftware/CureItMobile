                                    Blood Cancers are diseases in which normal blood cell development is disturbed by the unchecked growth of a varient on an ordinary blood cell.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    There are 3 primary forms of Blood Cancer: Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma. We will get into the specifics of each in just a moment. First, let us take a moment to acknowledge the problem as it currently exists.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    There are <span class = "link" onClick= "window.open('https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-leukemia-and-other-blood-cancers', '_blank', 'location=yes');">currently over 1 million people</span> in the United States who are living with, or have a history of, some form of Blood Cancer.

                                    <br />
                                    To provide a sense of context for these figures, consider the fact that someone in the United States is diagnosed with a blood Cancer every 4 minutes, and that deaths from Blood Cancer occur approximately once every 10 minutes.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    In fact, Leukemia - the second most common form of Blood Cancer - is <span class = "link" onClick= "window.open('https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-leukemia-and-other-blood-cancers', '_blank', 'location=yes');">the 10th most common</span> type of cancer when considering all races and ethnicities.

                    Leukemia is a form of Cancer that begins in the tissue that generates blood for the body. Leukemia turns a person's bone marrow against them, altering it to produce abnormal white blood cells.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    These cells are called Leukemia cells, and their presence makes it challenging for normal blood cells to function properly. This lack of proper functioning is where many of the health harms of Leukemia come from.

                        Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow. Individuals with this disease suffer from a disorderly production of unhealthy plasma cells that fill up the bone marrow, thus disrupting the production of normal blood cells.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This, in many cases, leads to an overabundance of plasma cells which damages the bone itself, which results in an excess of pain and potential bone fractures.

                        This is a field that has, even in just the past two years, exploded with activity. These types of improvements allow doctors to "teach" a patient's cells to seek out and destroy cancerous cells.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This can act as a welcome supplement to more aggressive forms of treatment, as it provides another avenue upon which cancer can be attacked, thus resulting in the long term safety and security of patients that may have struggled in the past.

					  However, recent years have brought with them innovations that have made these drugs not only more comfortable to experience, but also more effective.
