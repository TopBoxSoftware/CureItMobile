                    Cancer of the thyroid is fairly common relative to other cancers, and scientists are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/cancer/tc/thyroid-cancer-cause', '_blank', 'location=yes');">still trying to unravel</span> the mystery of what causes it.

                    As illustrated by the chart above, Papillary Carcinomas are the most frequent form of Thyroid Cancer. It is essential to first understand the implications of the cancer in regards to its location in the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-thyroid', '_blank', 'location=yes');">thyroid</span>.

                        The main purpose of the thyroid to regulate the prominence of certain hormones by sending them to key points in the body. This means that the thyroid has access to nearly every major organ in the body, something that enables cancerous cells to spread quickly and broadly.

                    Follicular Carcinomas are a relatively rare subset of Thyroid Cancer, accounting for just 17% of total cases. They share many similarities with Papillary Carcinomas, and as such are often described as being a specific varient of that form of Thyroid Cancer.  
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Both spread relatively easily, and both oiginate within the thyroid. However, there are a few differences that set it apart from other varients of Thyroid Cancer.
