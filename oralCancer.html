                    Oral Cancer is a disease in which a group of oral cells begins to divide uncontrollably, resulting in a tumorous mass. The term "Oral Cancer" can refer to cancers of the lips, cheeks, mouth, tounge, throat, as well as related reigons. 
					<br />
					<br />
					There are a  <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/types/l', '_blank', 'location=yes');">few different types of Oral Cancers</span>, and advanced knowledge of each of these is essential in terms of gaining an appreciation for the situation that Oral Cancer victims struggle with everyday. 
					<br />
					<br />
					The three that we will be analyzing later in this page are Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Verrucous Carcinomas.

                <div id = "content_holder" style = "top:179vh;">
                   Oral Cancers are sometimes difficult to detect due to the relatively unfrightening way in which the symptoms present themselves. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   While the symptoms are often quite visual, with bleeding sores and speckled white patches in the mouth, many fail to interpret them as being as serious as they actually are. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   This harm, at least in part, is provided by a lack of understanding for the issue of Oral Cancers. In fact, <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/types/l', '_blank', 'location=yes');">over 10 percent</span> of the United States population is completely unaware that of the threat of Oral Cancers.

                 Your throat and parts of your mouth are covered with many flat squamous cells. Contracting Squamous Cell Carcinoma means that some of these cells have become abnormal and are now actively fighting against the body.
