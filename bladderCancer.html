                    Bladder Cancer is one of the most common types of urinary cancers. In 2014, <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/urinb.html', '_blank', 'location=yes');">there were approximately 75,000 diagnoses of Bladder Cancer</span>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    
                    There were <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/urinb.html', '_blank', 'location=yes');">16,000 deaths</span>, amounting to <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/urinb.html', '_blank', 'location=yes');">around 3%</span> of all cancer related fatalities in that year. Unfortunately, the number of diagnoses has increased by nearly a quarter over the last decade.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    
                    This is largely due to the increase in the quality of medical equipment used to perform biopsies and find cancer in the first place, as well as environmental carcinogens.

                    Bladder Cancer is  <span class = "link" onTouchEnd = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/urinb.html', '_blank', 'location=yes');">three to four times more common in men than women</span> and is most common in middle and old age. Thankfully, Bladder Cancer typically responds well to treatment, so early diagnoses usually result in remission.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    That being said, failure to discover this disease in a timely manner can be dangerous, and Stage III and IV Bladder Cancer is often terminal.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Just like many other types of cancer, the diagnosis rate has been steadily increasing over the past few years, while fatalities decrease.

Cells in the lining of the bladder often come into contact with toxic chemicals in urine waste.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since some of these chemicals are carcinogens, these cells can get damaged and form into tumors. Over time, the cancer can spread into the tissue surrounding the bladder and metastasize from there.

                    <br />
                    When infected, they die quickly, so they are less prone to growing out of control and becoming cancerous than transitional cells. Squamous cells are identified by their spongy nature and flat, rectangular shape.

                        Recent years have yielded advances in treatment of Bladder Cancer. One of the most promising is the application of photodynamic therapy. This practice involves injecting small, light-sensitive chemicals into the bloodstream of a patient.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These chemicals accrue along the lining of the bladder and “stick” to cancerous cells. This technique is effective at killing cancer cells along the lining of the bladder wall.

                        Intravesical immunotherapy is a promising new style of Bladder Cancer treatment. Doctors administer drugs to a patient’s bladder by directly introducing them via a catheter instead of giving the patient a pill or an injection.
