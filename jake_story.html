            <span style = "position:relative;top:-30px;">
	In December of 2014 I was having very dull and mild pain on my left side, so like most people I hopped on the Internet and self diagnosed myself with a hernia. At the time I didn't have insurance so I had to wait until February to see my primary care doctor.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I saw my doctor he felt around on my abdomen, felt my testicles and had me cough, he then told me I had a bacterial infection in my testicles called epididymitis and prescribed me anti-inflammatories and antibiotics. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Within 5 days my left testicle swelled up 3 times the size of my right. I called my doctor and he advised me to go to the ER. So I went to the ER and the doctor there also said it was a bacterial infection but he would do an ultra sound just to be sure. 
                <br />
                <br />
                About 4 hours later he came back into my room and started asking me if I had a family history of testicular cancer. My heart felt like it sank into my stomach. I told him no, he then proceeded to tell me the ultra sound had found a tumor on my left testicle and I would need to see a urologist first thing in the morning. 
                <br />
                <br />
                So I went and saw the urologist the next day and he told me it was indeed a tumor but in order to biopsy it they would need to remove the testicle, so they scheduled me for surgery one week later. This was all extremely difficult to process. I let my family know of the situation but stayed very optimistic that the tumor would be benign. 
                <br />
                <br />
                So I had surgery which was very uncomfortable for about 2 weeks. I needed help getting up and down from chairs and out of bed. About 3 weeks after the surgery I went back to the urologist and he seemed to be very up best so I'm thinking he's going to give me good news. Wrong. It was indeed cancer. 
                <br />
                <br />
                They way he explained it was I had the "good kind" which was called "seminoma" and could be treated by radiation. He then scheduled me for a CT scan before I went to see a radiation oncologist. I went for the CT scan later that week and followed up with the urologist the next day. 
                <br />
                <br />
                He informed me the cancer was stage 2 and had spread the the lymph nodes and I needed to see an oncologist. The next day I met with a radiation oncologist and he gave me even more bad news. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The initial biopsy was incorrect and the cancer I had was a rarer form of testicular cancer (non-seminoma) and is completely resistant I radiation. So he sent me down the hall to meet with a medical oncologist. He told me I would need to go through chemotherapy.
